# spotify-clone
It is a spotify clone based on HTML , CSS and Javascript . There is a list of approx ten songs which you can choose to play . I have added button in front of every song so it's easy to play song just click the button and your favourite melody will start to play . There are two buttons in the nav-baar but the fun fact is don't both don't work since it is only a one page website . In the bottom section I have added a progress-bar which will reflect back the progress of the song .
